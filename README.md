## how to set this up
If you are on a VM, first check your available space with

```bash
df -h
```

If you have less than 7GB of space, free up some space. Probably you need to remove a .venv.
You can check size with

```bash
du -sh *
```

To pull the datafiles, you need to install [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.com), see link for other OS than linux:

```bash
sudo apt install git-lfs
```


If you have sufficient space, do this:
1. clone the repo
2. Run `git lfs pull` to get the datafiles
3. create your own private repo on github, copy your-repo-url
4. in the cloned repo, change the remote url with `git remote set-url origin <your-repo-url>` such that you can push to your-repo-url
5. use the pyproject.toml to install the dependencies. The file is compatible with both uv and rye.

## The case
The junior datascientist at your work is pretty confident about his knowledge of all the models; He has helped you out by doing some data exploration for you, and he even created two models! You can find the models in `src/models.py`, but they are also in the notebooks themselves.

However, he didnt learn to hypertune things, and you are hired as a junior+ datascientist and he has heard you had pretty high grades in the machine learning course. In addition to that, you are always telling weird stories about how vision models are the same as searching for undigested owl pellets in the forest, and while he doesnt really understands what you are talking about he got the impression that you might be able to help him out.

His hopes are you are able to hypertune the models, but that you might also come up with some creative ideas about how to improve the models.

## The data
We have two datasets:
### The PTB Diagnostic ECG Database

- Number of Samples: 14552
- Number of Categories: 2
- Sampling Frequency: 125Hz
- Data Source: Physionet's PTB Diagnostic Database

All the samples are cropped, downsampled and padded with zeroes if necessary to the fixed dimension of 187. There is a target column named "target".

You can find this in `data/heart_train.parq` and `data/heart_test.parq`.

### Arrhythmia Dataset

- Number of Samples: 109446
- Number of Categories: 5
- Sampling Frequency: 125Hz
- Data Source: Physionet's MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset
- Classes: ['N': 0, 'S': 1, 'V': 2, 'F': 3, 'Q': 4]
All the samples are cropped, downsampled and padded with zeroes if necessary to the fixed dimension of 187. There is a target column named "target".

You can find this in `data/heart_big_train.parq` and `data/heart_big_test.parq`.

## Analysis
In `notebooks/01_explore-heart.ipynb` you can find some visualisations. It's not much, and
he hasnt had time to add a lot of comments, but he thinks it's pretty self explanatory for
someone with your skill level.

## Models
There are two notebooks with models. He has tried two approaches: a 2D approach, and a 1D approach. Yes, he is aware that this is a time series, but he has read that 2D approaches can work well for timeseries, and he has tried it out.

# Your task
Your task is to create a model for the Arrhythmia dataset. The PTB dataset might be used to test some architectures, or maybe to pretrain a model, but it isnt mandatory to use. During the process, you will be going through an iterative scientific process:
1. Create a hypothesis
2. Create an experiment to test your hypothesis
3. Reflect on the results
4. Go back to 1 to refine your hypothesis

During the process, it is advised you keep track of your ideas, hypotheses and expectations in a journal; think of this as a logbook with short notes and timestamps. A suggestion is to use https://jrnl.sh/en/stable/ for fast note taking directly from the cli, but you can essentially use anything, even pen and paper.

# 1. Explore
First, have a look at the notebooks. Then, take a step back and try to make an inventory of all possible solutions:
- What models might work here?
- What are ranges of hyperparameters you think are reasonable?

Change and expand the existing models: add more parameters you might want to tune, add additional layers, etc.
In addition to that, think about other strategies beyond the two models. Try to balance exploit (improve what is already there) and explore (creativity/curiosity of new things).

Try to formulate your hypothesis: what do you think will work best, and why? Connect your ideas to theory.
Then, try to set up some experiments to test your ideas. Implement them in a flexible way, so you can easily change the hyperparameters.
Test, and reflect on the results by looking at your hypotheses; what surprised you, and most important, WHY did it surprise you?
Do some manual hypertuing to get a feel for the models and what might work, or what does not.

Because this is a medical dataset, an we are trying to spot disease, recall is more important than precision. Make sure you take this into account when you are creating and evaluating models! This means you might need to be creative about the preprocessing, or maybe combine approaches, etc.

Be smart with the number of epochs. If you are doing manual tests, you can lower the amount of epochs.
However, you will need some more training than just 1 epoch (which is equivalent with 5 epochs when trainsteps is set to one fifth of the full dataset), especially for the underrepresented classes. So try to set up experiments that can run unattended for a longer time without the need of your constant supervision.

## 2 Hypertune
### 2.1 Select
Once you have some idea of what works, and what doesnt, you can make a selection of interesting directions.
Make your selection based on your hypotheses of what might work, and what you have seen in the manual hypertuning.
### 2.2 Tune
Set up a `hypertune.py` file and hypertune the models with Ray. Make sure you log everything thats relevant for your model (eg with ray / mlflow).
## 2.3 Analyse
Make your hypertuning iterative too; you have an hypothesis, do an experiment, think about what it means, log those ideas, and set up a new experiment with a different range of parameters. Make smart use of approaches like gridsearch, randomsearch, bayesian optimization, hyperband, etc.

Make sure you save all plots you might need for your report.
## 3. Reflect
Create a short summary (max 2 pages content) of your results.
1. Start with an overview of your top architectures. Make sure someone can reproduce your model based on your description.
2. Describe your searchspace, and show the relevant hyperparameters you have tuned. You can take inspiration from table 3 in the (attention is all you need)[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf] paper for an excelent summary of hypertuning.
3. Connect your results to your hypotheses. What did you discover? What are new insights? What hypotheses were confirmed, and which were rejected?

Export your report to pdf (you can use latex, which will also be useful for your master theses. This is a useful template https://github.com/raoulg/paper-template if you are interested)

When you are done, do two things:
1. Make your own **private** repo and invite https://github.com/raoulg to your repo as a collaborator
2. push all your code, and add the pdf to the repo.

# Rubric
You will be graded for:
- Overall presentation and clarity of your work (organisation, comments, typehinting, etc). (10%)
- The level of change and expansion of the models: balance performance (exploit) and creativity/curiosity (explore). (30%)
- The quality of your implementation of the hypertuning in your codebase (20%)
- The clarity and relevance of your reflection on the hyperparameters, models and hypotheses (40%)
